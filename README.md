ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MHaakash-web

This project is called - ** The Task Master **

### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/yGjWkzCYofU

### Description:
- As the name suggests, this is a simple web-application that essentially works as a to-do list.

- When you first enter the web-app, you will find the words "No task to show" since there are no tasks to begin with, and right above that you'll find an input placeholder and a button to add your tasks.

- Once you add a task to it, the page will reload and you'll see it in a tabular form with two options for updating and deleting the task. The input placeholder and button will still be there to add more tasks.

- Clicking the update button will take you to the update page and the delete button will do it's job too.

- If you try to input an all spaces input as a task or nothing as input by simply clicking the add button, it will not be accepted. Also, while updating a task, if you do the same thing mentioned earlier, the task will simply be deleted.

- Notice how the add and update buttons transform when you hover over them. The update and delete icons also behave in a certain way when you hover over them.

- If you want to use it, remember to install the necessary python header files first.

# Have a nice day.
